# GitHub overlay

- The GitHub tracker is a transparent left-side rail with only contribution squares.
- `GITHUB_USERNAME` controls the rendered account. `GH_USERNAME` is also accepted. If both are missing, the fetcher tries `git config github.user` and then the GitHub remote owner.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional and only used for authenticated requests to the public contributions endpoint.
- Set `GITHUB_OVERLAY_ENABLED=0` to disable the GitHub overlay and its refresh loop.
- `GITHUB_REFRESH_SECONDS`, `GITHUB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `GITHUB_GAP_X`, and `GITHUB_GAP_Y` can tune refresh cadence, request timeout, and placement.
